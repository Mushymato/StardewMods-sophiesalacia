TO DO

#### If you have any issues:
* Read the documentation carefully. I have tried to be as thorough as possible.
* Make sure SMAPI and Content Patcher are up-to-date.
* You can reach me on the Stardew Valley discord (sophiesalacia#0001) or on the Nexus mod page (Discord is preferred).
* Please provide a SMAPI log, as well as your mod files, so that I can assist you better.
