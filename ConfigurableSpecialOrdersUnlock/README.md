#### Configurable Special Orders Unlock
*by sophie*

This mod seeks to make the Special Orders board more immediately accessible to the player. It does so by allowing the player (or host, if playing online) to modify
the date on which the Special Orders board is unlocked, and optionally whether or not to skip the corresponding cutscene.

Note: This mod has not been thoroughly tested for multiplayer use. Please report any issues you come across on the Nexus mod page.
